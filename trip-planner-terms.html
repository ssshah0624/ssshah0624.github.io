    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Trip Planner Plus (“Brightwood Apps LLC”, “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)! By using our service, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Communications</h2>
    <p>By creating an account on our service, you agree to receive promotional materials from us. You may opt-out at any time by following the unsubscribe link or contacting us.</p>

    <h2>3. Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you wish to make a purchase through our app, you may need to provide payment and billing information. You agree that the information provided is accurate and authorize us to process the transaction.</p>
    <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
    <p>We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some parts of our app may require a subscription, billed on a recurring basis. This will typically be billed in advance on an annual basis. Your subscription will renew automatically unless you cancel it before the end of the billing cycle or Brightwood Apps LLC cancels it.</p>

    <h2>5. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We may offer a free trial at our discretion. You will not be charged until the trial ends, and you can cancel anytime before it expires to avoid charges.</p>
    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.</p>

    <h2>6. Fee Changes</h2>
    <p>Brightwood Apps LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
    <p>We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

    <h2>7. Refunds</h2>
    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>8. Content</h2>
    <p>Our app may allow users to post content. By posting, you grant us a license to use, display, and distribute the content. You are responsible for ensuring it complies with copyright terms otherwise.</p>
    <p>By posting Content on or through Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.</p>
    <p>You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through Service. However, by posting Content using Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through Service. You agree that this license includes the right for us to make your Content available to other users of Service, who may also use your Content subject to these Terms.</p>

    <p>We have the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all Content provided by users.</p>

    <h3>Objectionable Content</h3>
        <p>You are not allowed to post content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy. Examples of such content include:</p>

        <p>Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the content is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group.
        Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence.
        Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition.
        Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.”
        Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.
        Intentionally false and misleading information, including inaccurate place data or false content that resemble jokes.
        If you discover objectionable content, you may email us to alert us to it. If we deem the content to be objectionable, we will usually take action within 24 hours.</p>

        We will promptly remove objectionable content and expel users who post objectionable content.</p>

    <h2>9. Prohibited Uses & AI</h2>
    <p>Use our app only for lawful purposes. You agree not to use it in a way that is harmful, fraudulent, or infringes the rights of others.</p>
    <p>We do employ the use of AI through our application. If you are found using the AI in a way that's considered inappropriate or against the terms of OpenAI, Anthropic or Claude, we reserve the right to permanently cancel your account without a refund or to remove your access to AI features without notice.</p>
    <p>Your use of AI will also fall into our Terms around Objectionable Content.</p>

    <h2>10. Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or use of your account.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
