    <p>
      Call GPT ("we", "our", or "us") is a service operated by Brightwood Apps that allows users to initiate real phone calls via an AI-powered voice agent in order to request, schedule, or confirm appointments with third-party businesses. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Call GPT, you acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing our system to place phone calls on your behalf and to process information you voluntarily provide for that purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information You Provide</h2>
    <p>
      We collect information that you voluntarily submit when using Call GPT, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appointment details:</strong> Business names, locations, requested services, preferred dates and times, and any notes or instructions you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity references:</strong> Your name or preferred name, which may be used by the voice agent solely to indicate that a booking is being made on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Phone numbers or other contact details necessary to complete or confirm an appointment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate, lawful, and that you have the right to share it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Call Data and Recordings</h2>
    <p>
      Calls placed through Call GPT occur between our automated voice agent and third-party businesses. We may collect and store:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Call recordings (audio)</li>
      <li>Call transcripts or summaries</li>
      <li>Call status, timestamps, duration, and outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These recordings and related data may be used for service operation, quality assurance, debugging, analytics, safety monitoring, and improving system performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      You acknowledge that businesses you call may also record calls under their own policies and applicable laws. We are not responsible for the data practices of those third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To place phone calls and attempt to complete appointment requests on your behalf</li>
      <li>To relay outcomes, confirmations, or failures back to you</li>
      <li>To improve accuracy, reliability, and system performance</li>
      <li>To detect abuse, fraud, or misuse of the service</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations, if applicable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Representation and Consent</h2>
    <p>
      The Call GPT voice agent does <strong>not</strong> impersonate you. It explicitly represents itself as an automated assistant calling on your behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using the service, you represent and warrant that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You consent to calls being placed on your behalf</li>
      <li>You understand and accept that calls may be recorded</li>
      <li>You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, including consent and recording laws in relevant jurisdictions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We share limited data only with third parties necessary to operate the service, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Telephony providers</strong> that enable call placement and connectivity</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure providers</strong> for hosting, storage, and monitoring</li>
      <li><strong>Platform providers</strong> such as ChatGPT, which process your inputs under their own terms and policies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These third parties process data solely to provide their services to us and are subject to their own privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information only for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the service, improve performance, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may request deletion of your account or associated data by emailing
      <a href="mailto:admin@brightwoodapps.com">admin@brightwoodapps.com</a>.
      We will make reasonable efforts to honor deletion requests, subject to legal and operational requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and you acknowledge and accept this risk.
    </p>

    <h2>8. No Professional or Legal Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      Call GPT is provided on an <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> basis. We do not guarantee that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An appointment will be successfully booked</li>
      <li>A business will answer or cooperate</li>
      <li>Information received from third parties will be accurate or complete</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We are not responsible for missed appointments, scheduling errors, miscommunications, or any actions taken by third-party businesses.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Brightwood Apps and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of Call GPT.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your use of the service is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for verifying appointment details and outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Brightwood Apps from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses arising out of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The information you provide</li>
      <li>Your use or misuse of the service</li>
      <li>Your violation of any applicable law or third-party rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Call GPT is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of Call GPT after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
