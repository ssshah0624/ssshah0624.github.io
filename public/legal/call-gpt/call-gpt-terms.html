    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Call GPT (the “Service”), operated by Brightwood Apps (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      Call GPT enables users to initiate real phone calls through an automated voice agent for the purpose of requesting, scheduling, or confirming appointments with third-party businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service acts solely as a technical intermediary. We do not own, operate, control, or endorse any third-party businesses contacted through the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Authorization to Act on Your Behalf</h2>
    <p>
      By using Call GPT, you expressly authorize us to place phone calls on your behalf using an automated voice agent and to convey information you provide to third-party businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      The voice agent does <strong>not</strong> impersonate you and does not claim to be you. It identifies itself as an assistant calling on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of all information you provide</li>
      <li>Ensuring that requested calls and recordings comply with applicable local, state, and federal laws</li>
      <li>Verifying appointment details, confirmations, cancellations, or changes</li>
      <li>Any costs, obligations, or consequences associated with appointments you request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You agree not to use the Service for unlawful, deceptive, harassing, abusive, or spam-related purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Call Recording and Consent</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that calls placed through the Service may be recorded, transcribed, or summarized for operational, quality assurance, analytics, and system improvement purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are solely responsible for ensuring that any required consent for call recording is lawful in the relevant jurisdiction. Brightwood Apps disclaims all liability related to recording consent laws.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Guarantees or Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>
      We do not guarantee that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A call will be answered</li>
      <li>An appointment will be successfully booked</li>
      <li>Information provided by third parties will be accurate or complete</li>
      <li>A business will honor or correctly record an appointment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Service does not provide medical, legal, financial, or professional advice of any kind.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Emergency Use</h2>
    <p>
      Call GPT is not intended for emergency situations. Do not use the Service for medical emergencies, urgent care, or time-sensitive safety matters. If you have an emergency, contact local emergency services immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party providers, including telephony, infrastructure, and platform services. We are not responsible for outages, errors, delays, or failures caused by third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your interactions with third-party businesses are solely between you and those businesses.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Suspension and Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or pose risk to the Service or others.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BRIGHTWOOD APPS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
    </p>

    <p>
      IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 USD OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Brightwood Apps and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use or misuse of the Service</li>
      <li>The information you provide</li>
      <li>Your violation of any law or third-party rights</li>
      <li>Your interactions with third-party businesses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, and not as part of a class, collective, or representative action.
    </p>

    <p>
      You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>
