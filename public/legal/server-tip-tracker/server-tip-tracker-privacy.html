      <p>Server Tip Tracker (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is designed for tipped and hourly workers who want clear insight into their earnings. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. It applies to the Server Tip Tracker mobile app and any related pages that link to this policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information needed to help you track and analyze your earnings and to keep the app running reliably.</p>

      <h3>1.1 Information you enter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shift entries:</strong> Tips, hours worked, hourly wages, dates, and optional notes you enter into the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Employers and roles:</strong> Company names, locations, and job titles you add to organize your shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Preferences such as date ranges, filters, and display options.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your shift, employer, and settings data are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to our own servers.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Diagnostics and analytics</h3>
      <p>To understand how people use the app and to keep it stable, we may collect limited technical information, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>App version, device type, operating system version, and language.</li>
        <li>Anonymous or aggregated usage events (for example, which screens are visited, which buttons are tapped, and general feature usage).</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use this kind of analytics only to understand how users move through the app and to improve the product. We do not use analytics to reconstruct your individual shift history, and we do not sell your data to advertisers.</p>

      <h3>1.3 Communication with us</h3>
      <p>If you contact us by email or other channels, we may collect your name, email address, and the content of your message so we can respond and keep a record of support requests.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide the core app experience:</strong> Calculate earnings totals, averages, and trends; display insights across dates, weekdays, employers, and roles; and show summaries and reports on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve the app:</strong> Use aggregated and anonymous analytics and diagnostics to understand which features are most useful, find bugs, and prioritize future improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>To provide support:</strong> Respond to your questions, troubleshoot issues, and maintain records of support interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations:</strong> Where applicable, comply with law, regulation, or valid legal process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device storage:</strong> Your shift, employer, and note data are stored locally on your device. We do not transfer this data to our own servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> If you choose to back up your device (for example, using iCloud, Google, or another backup provider), those services may store a copy of your app data. Their terms and privacy policies apply to those backups.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Your data stays on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Support emails and related records may be kept as long as needed to provide support and maintain business records, unless you reasonably request deletion where applicable law allows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party services (such as analytics and crash-reporting providers) to help us understand how the app is used and to improve stability and performance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>These services may receive technical information such as device type, app version, general usage events, and crash details.</li>
        <li>We do not send your individual shift entries (tips, hours, wages, or notes) to third-party analytics providers for their own use.</li>
        <li>We do not sell your personal information or share your shift data with advertisers for targeted advertising.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may be able to limit certain types of analytics collection in your device settings (for example, by turning off “Share iPhone Analytics” or similar options, depending on your device and operating system).</p>

      <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. We share information only in limited situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With trusted providers who perform services on our behalf (such as analytics, crash reporting, or email hosting), and only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to provide those services.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> If we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to enforce our terms; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this Privacy Policy or a successor policy that offers similar protections.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We rely on the security model of your device’s operating system (such as Apple’s iOS) for local data storage. You can help protect your data by using a secure device passcode and enabling features like device encryption and automatic backups.</p>
      <p>If you contact support, emails are transmitted using standard encryption in transit (such as TLS). We take reasonable steps to protect any information we receive, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manage your data in the app:</strong> You can edit or delete shift entries, employers, and notes directly in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Export (if available):</strong> If the app includes an export feature, you can use it to obtain a copy of your data for your own records.</li>
        <li><strong>Device-level controls:</strong> You may adjust your device settings (for example, analytics and crash-reporting preferences) to limit certain types of data collection.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact us:</strong> You can ask questions about this policy or our data practices at <a href="mailto:admin@brightwoodapps.com">admin@brightwoodapps.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Server Tip Tracker is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps to remove it.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect new features, services, or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. In some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as a notice in the app) or seek your consent where required by law.</p>
      <p>If we introduce new features that require sending more of your data to our servers (for example, optional cloud backup or account-based sync), we will update this policy to explain what is collected and how it is used before those features launch or as required by applicable law.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@brightwoodapps.com">admin@brightwoodapps.com</a>.</p>
