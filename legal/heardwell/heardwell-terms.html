    <p>These Terms of Service (<strong>“Terms”</strong>) form a legally binding agreement between Brightwood Apps&nbsp;LLC d/b/a Heardwell (<strong>“Heardwell,” “we,” “us,” or “our”</strong>) and the individual or entity (<strong>“you”</strong>) who accesses or uses the Heardwell proprietary mobile and web application, APIs, widgets, scripts, documentation, and associated services (collectively, the <strong>“Service”</strong>). By clicking “I Agree,” creating an account, or otherwise accessing the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a>. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

    <h2 id="definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Authorized User”</strong> means an individual you authorize to access the Service on your behalf, including employees or contractors.</li>
      <li><strong>“BAA”</strong> means a Business Associate Agreement executed between Heardwell and a Covered Entity under HIPAA.</li>
      <li><strong>“Clinician Content”</strong> means audio, transcripts, SOAP notes, or other data you or your Authorized Users upload or generate via the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>“Order Form”</strong> means an ordering document or online subscription plan specifying Service tiers, seats, and pricing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility; Authority</h2>
    <p>You represent that you are at least 18&nbsp;years old and have the legal authority to enter into these Terms. If you accept on behalf of a clinic or other legal entity, you warrant that you have authority to bind that entity, and <em>“you”</em> will refer to the entity and its Affiliates.</p>

    <h2 id="license">3. License &amp; Access Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms and payment of all fees, Heardwell grants you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable, revocable right for Authorized Users to access and use the Service solely for your internal clinical, administrative, and research purposes during the Subscription Term.</p>

    <h3 id="restrictions">3.1 Restrictions</h3>
    <p>You will not (and will not permit anyone else to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>reverse‑engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover source code;</li>
      <li>modify, copy (except routine backups), or create derivative works of the Service;</li>
      <li>rent, resell, or commercially exploit the Service except as expressly permitted;</li>
      <li>bypass or breach any security, usage, or rate limits;</li>
      <li>introduce malicious code, spam, or unlawful content;</li>
      <li>use the Service to develop a competing product or service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="accounts">4. Accounts &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>Each Authorized User must create unique credentials and, where prompted, enable multi‑factor authentication. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your accounts. You agree to keep credentials confidential and notify us immediately of any unauthorized use. We may suspend access to address suspected security incidents.</p>

    <h2 id="clinician-content">5. Clinician Content &amp; Data Ownership</h2>
    <p>You retain all ownership rights in Clinician Content. You grant Heardwell a worldwide, royalty‑free license to process Clinician Content solely (a) to provide, maintain, and improve the Service; (b) to comply with legal obligations; and (c) as otherwise permitted under your BAA. Heardwell acquires no ownership in Clinician Content.</p>

    <h2 id="hipaa">6. Protected Health Information &amp; HIPAA</h2>
    <p>Where you are a Covered Entity or Business Associate under HIPAA, the parties will execute a BAA governing the processing of PHI, which is incorporated by reference. In the event of conflict, the BAA controls with respect to PHI.</p>

    <h2 id="fees">7. Fees &amp; Payment</h2>
    <p>Fees are set forth in the applicable Order Form or online plan and are billed in advance. All payments are due within thirty (30) days of invoice unless otherwise stated. Late payments may accrue interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate) and may result in suspension. Fees are exclusive of taxes, which you are responsible for unless you provide a valid tax‑exemption certificate.</p>

    <h2 id="third-party">8. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may interoperate with third‑party applications (e.g., EHRs, cloud storage). Your use of any third‑party services is subject to those providers’ terms. Heardwell is not liable for third‑party services.</p>

    <h2 id="service-changes">9. Service Changes &amp; Updates</h2>
    <p>We may modify or discontinue features from time to time, provided that we will not materially reduce core transcription and note‑generation functionality during your paid Subscription Term without prior notice.</p>

    <h2 id="feedback">10. Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you submit feedback or ideas about the Service, you grant Heardwell an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use that feedback for any purpose.</p>

    <h2 id="ownership">11. Intellectual‑Property Ownership</h2>
    <p>Heardwell and its licensors own all right, title, and interest in the Service, including all software, documentation, and underlying technology. No rights are granted except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>

    <h2 id="confidentiality">12. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Each party (the <strong>“Receiving Party”</strong>) shall keep confidential all non‑public information disclosed by the other party (<strong>“Disclosing Party”</strong>) that is marked or reasonably should be understood to be confidential (<strong>“Confidential Information”</strong>). Confidential Information excludes information that is (a) publicly available without breach; (b) already known by the Receiving Party; (c) independently developed; or (d) rightfully obtained from a third party. The Receiving Party will use reasonable care to protect Confidential Information and may disclose it only to employees and service providers who need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective.</p>

    <h2 id="disclaimers">13. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” HEARDWELL DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. HEARDWELL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE ERROR‑FREE, OR OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="liability">14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL HEARDWELL’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO HEARDWELL FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</strong></p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL HEARDWELL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR BUSINESS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.</p>

    <h2 id="indemnification">15. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Heardwell and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of (a) Clinician Content; (b) your or an Authorized User’s breach of these Terms or violation of law; or (c) your use of the Service in a manner not authorized herein.</p>

    <h2 id="termination">16. Term &amp; Termination</h2>
    <p>These Terms remain in effect for the Subscription Term stated in your Order Form and automatically renew unless either party provides at least thirty (30) days’ written notice prior to renewal. Either party may terminate for material breach if not cured within thirty (30) days of notice. Upon termination, your access rights cease, and, upon written request within thirty (30) days, we will provide a one‑time export of remaining Clinician Content before deleting it per our retention schedule.</p>

    <h2 id="modifications">17. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise these Terms by posting an updated version on our website or notifying you in‑app. Material changes will take effect thirty (30) days after notice. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service and may request a pro‑rated refund for the unused portion of your Subscription Term.</p>

    <h2 id="disputes">18. Dispute Resolution &amp; Arbitration</h2>
    <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will take place in Morris County, New Jersey, USA, unless the parties agree otherwise, and will be conducted in English. The arbitrator’s award will be final and binding.</p>

    <h3 id="class-waiver">18.1 Class‑Action Waiver</h3>
    <p>All proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis; class, collective, or representative actions are prohibited. You and Heardwell agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity.</p>

    <h2 id="governing-law">19. Governing Law &amp; Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules. Subject to the arbitration clause, the state and federal courts located in Morris County, New Jersey have exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes not subject to arbitration.</p>

    <h2 id="export">20. Export Compliance &amp; Sanctions</h2>
    <p>You may not use or export the Service in violation of U.S. export laws, embargoes, or sanctions programs.</p>

    <h2 id="misc">21. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without Heardwell’s prior written consent; any attempt is void. Heardwell may assign freely.</li>
      <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Waiver.</strong> A party’s failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement.</li>
      <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, the Privacy Policy, any BAA, and Order Forms constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements on the subject matter.</li>
    </ul>
