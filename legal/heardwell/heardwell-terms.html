              >.” Each Authorized User must create unique Login Credentials
              consisting of an email address and password. Login Credentials may
              not be shared or reused and must be kept confidential. You agree
              to ensure that all Authorized Users use strong, unique passwords
              and, where prompted, multi‑factor authentication.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are fully responsible for all activities (including any
              misuse) that occur under your and your Authorized Users’ accounts.
              You will: (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use or
              security breach; (b) promptly deactivate or reassign Login
              Credentials when an Authorized User leaves your organization or no
              longer requires access; and (c) ensure that all Authorized Users
              comply with this Agreement. We may disable any account or
              credential if we believe it is being misused or compromised.

            <h2 id="trials">3. Trials</h2>
            <p>

              Users on a free‑trial basis for the number of visits or duration
              specified when you sign up (the “<strong>Trial Period</strong>”).
              Trial access is provided solely so you can evaluate the Platform
              and decide whether to purchase a Subscription. During the Trial
              Period you may not use the Platform for commercial, professional,
              revenue‑generating, or competitive purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
              We reserve the right in our sole discretion to terminate or
              suspend your or any Authorized User’s trial access at any time.
              You may cancel the Trial at any time during the Trial Period by
              providing written notice to us. Unless you purchase a Subscription
              before the end of the Trial Period, your access will automatically
              terminate when the Trial Period expires.

              Access to the Platform requires purchase of a monthly or annual

              >”) are disclosed at sign‑up and are billed in advance via our
              third‑party payment processor. BY PROVIDING A PAYMENT METHOD YOU
              AUTHORIZE HEARDWELL (OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR) TO CHARGE ALL
              SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND APPLICABLE TAXES TO THAT PAYMENT METHOD ON A

            </p>

            <p>
              You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing
              information and promptly update all information to keep your
              payment method valid (for example, a change in billing address,
              credit‑card number, or expiration date). You must promptly notify
              us if your payment method is canceled (e.g., due to loss or theft)
              or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as
              the unauthorized disclosure or use of your username or password.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your Subscription will automatically renew at the then‑current
              rate unless you cancel through your account dashboard or by
              emailing

              law. We may change our pricing or add new fees by posting an
              update on the Platform or otherwise notifying you; fee changes

            </p>

            <h3>4.&nbsp;Term and Termination</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>a.&nbsp;Term.</strong> This BAA is effective as of the
              Effective Date and shall terminate when all PHI provided to
              Business Associate, or created or received by Business Associate
              on behalf of Covered Entity, is destroyed or returned to Covered
              Entity, or when protections are extended as described herein
              because return or destruction is infeasible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>b.&nbsp;Material Breach.</strong> A material breach of
              this BAA by either party constitutes a material breach of the
              Terms of Use if not cured within thirty&nbsp;(30) days after
              written notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>c.&nbsp;Judicial or Administrative Proceedings.</strong>
              Either party may terminate this BAA immediately if the other party
              is named as a defendant in a criminal proceeding for a HIPAA
              violation or there is a finding of a HIPAA violation in a civil or
              administrative proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>d.&nbsp;Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination,
              Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI, unless
              infeasible, in which case protections of this BAA shall continue
              for so long as Business Associate retains the PHI.
            </p>

            <h3>5.&nbsp;Amendment</h3>
            <p>
              The parties agree to take such action as is necessary to amend
              this BAA to comply with changes in applicable law, including
              HIPAA, the HIPAA Rules, and the HITECH Act. Either party may
              terminate this BAA on thirty&nbsp;(30) days’ written notice if the
              other party does not promptly enter into such an amendment when
              requested.
            </p>

            <h3>6.&nbsp;No Third‑Party Beneficiaries</h3>

              Nothing in this BAA is intended to confer any rights, remedies, or
              obligations upon any person other than the parties and their
              respective successors and assigns.
            </p>

            <h3>7.&nbsp;Effect on Terms of Use</h3>
            <p>
              Except as specifically required to implement the purposes of this
              BAA, or as otherwise inconsistent with this BAA, the Terms of Use
              remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h3>8.&nbsp;Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              This BAA shall be interpreted as broadly as necessary to comply
              with HIPAA and other applicable laws concerning PHI. Any ambiguity
              shall be resolved to permit such compliance.
            </p>

            <h3>9.&nbsp;Regulatory References</h3>
            <p>
              A reference in this BAA to a section in the HIPAA Rules or the
              HITECH Act means the section as in effect or as amended, and for
              which compliance is required.
